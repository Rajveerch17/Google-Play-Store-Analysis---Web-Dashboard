📊 Google Play Store Real-Time Data Analytics Dashboard
A Data Analysis & Visualization Project using Python, Plotly, HTML & CSS

📝 Project Overview
This project was developed as a part of my internship training with NullClass, under the topic:
"Learn to Build Real-Time Google Play Store Data Analytics using Python."

The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world scenario where large-scale app data from the Google Play Store is analyzed, cleaned, visualized, and finally deployed as a web dashboard. The focus was not just on technical implementation, but also on generating meaningful business insights from real-time data and learning the essentials of dashboard deployment.

💡 What I Learned
Throughout this project, I explored and applied various core concepts of data analytics and visualization, which included:

🔹 1. Data Cleaning
The raw dataset was messy and unstructured. My first step involved:

Removing missing/null values

Dealing with incorrect and inconsistent data formats

Converting currency, app sizes (e.g., MB to GB), and install counts to numerical values

Removing special characters and handling outliers

These steps helped in preparing the dataset for analysis and ensured accuracy in insights.

🔹 2. Data Transformation
After cleaning, I transformed the data into a format suitable for analysis. This included:

Aggregating data based on categories and types

Creating new columns for time-based analysis (e.g., extracting the year from the 'Last Updated' field)

Calculating total revenue, average ratings, and sentiment scores

Label encoding and categorization for visualization purposes

This phase was crucial for uncovering deeper insights that are not directly visible in raw data.

🔹 3. Data Visualization using Plotly
I used Plotly to build interactive, visually appealing charts. These included:

📊 Bar Charts: To show top categories, install counts, revenue by category, and genre popularity

📈 Line Chart: To visualize trends in app updates over the years

📉 Histogram: To observe rating distribution and sentiment scores

🥧 Pie Chart: To depict the percentage of Free vs Paid apps

🧮 Box Plot: To compare rating behavior between Free and Paid apps

🔁 Scatter Plot: To see the relationship between app updates and user ratings

These charts helped highlight the structure of the Play Store app ecosystem and allowed interactive data exploration.

🔹 4. Web Dashboard Deployment (HTML + CSS)
To present the visualizations in a user-friendly format, I:

Exported the Plotly charts as standalone HTML files

Designed a simple yet effective layout using HTML

Styled the dashboard using basic CSS for dark theme and readability

Added Play Store-themed branding for visual appeal

This helped simulate a front-end dashboard for stakeholders to interact with real-time data.

📊 Dashboard Highlights (Based on the Image)
From the visual dashboard:

Top Categories: Family and Game apps dominate the Play Store.

App Type Distribution: Around 93% of the apps are Free, while only a small percentage are Paid.

Rating Distribution: Majority of the apps are rated between 4.0 and 5.0, indicating high user satisfaction.

Sentiment Analysis: Mixed sentiments with peaks around neutral to positive values.

Installs by Category: Game and Communication apps have the highest number of installs, showing user interest.

Updates Over Time: The number of updates has surged post-2016, reflecting app developers' efforts to stay competitive.

Revenue Insights: Game apps generate the highest revenue, followed by Social and Productivity apps.

Top Genres: Tools, Entertainment, and Personalization are among the most popular genres.

Last Update Impact: Apps updated more recently tend to have slightly higher ratings.

Paid vs Free: Paid apps often show higher median ratings, indicating better quality or experience.

These insights collectively provide a 360-degree view of the app market on the Google Play Store.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy – for data handling and transformation

Plotly Express – for building interactive visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – as the development environment

HTML & CSS – for dashboard layout and styling

Google Play Store Dataset – as the primary data source

📌 Project Outcome
This project helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of the data analytics workflow, from preprocessing raw data to deploying insights in a user-facing dashboard. It sharpened my skills in data wrangling, analytical thinking, visualization, and web integration, and prepared me to apply these skills in real-world industry projects.

✅ What’s Next?
I have successfully completed the training project phase of my internship at NullClass. I will now move on to the hands-on industry project, where I’ll apply these learnings in a real-time, live data environment.
