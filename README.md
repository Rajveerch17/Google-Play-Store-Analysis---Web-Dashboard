📊 Google Play Store Data Analytics Dashboard (Python + Plotly)

This repository showcases my internship training project at NullClass on the topic:“Learn to Build Real-Time Google Play Store Data Analytics – using Python”

🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a real-time interactive dashboard that analyzes Google Play Store data using Python, Plotly, and Jupyter Notebook — and to deploy the output using basic HTML & CSS in a web-friendly format.

I worked on various stages of the data pipeline, from cleaning and transforming raw app data to creating visual insights with interactive charts.

⚙️ Key Concepts Learned & Implemented

1) Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, fixed inconsistent formats.

- Ensured column types were properly structured for analysis.

2) Data Transformation

- Converted and engineered new features like sentiment scores, category grouping, and numeric conversions for installs/revenue.

3) Data Analysis

- Explored user behavior, app performance, sentiment trends, category-wise comparisons, etc.

4) Interactive Visualizations with Plotly

- Created dynamic, hoverable, zoomable charts like:

- Pie Charts (Top Free vs Paid apps)

- Bar Graphs (Category-wise Installs & Revenue)

- Histograms (Ratings distribution)

- Box Plots (Paid vs Free app ratings)

- Line Graphs (Update trends over years)

- Scatter Charts (Impact of last update on ratings)

5) Web Dashboard Deployment

- Used HTML and CSS to render the Plotly charts directly in the browser via Jupyter Notebook export.

🧪 Internship Task Highlights

During the internship phase, I was given a series of hands-on tasks designed to apply my skills in visualization, storytelling, and data analytics. Here's a breakdown of the tasks and tools used:

✅ Task 1: Sentiment Distribution – Stacked Bar Chart

Objective: Visualize the distribution of sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) based on user reviews.

- Tools & Techniques Used:

  - Used Plotly Express to build a stacked bar chart.

  - Grouped sentiment scores per app category to understand public opinion trends.

  - Applied color gradients to distinguish between sentiment classes.

✅ Task 2: Choropleth Map (6–8 PM IST)

Objective: Display regional insights of app data (hypothetical use case).

- Tools & Techniques Used:

  - Utilized Plotly’s choropleth geo feature to display a map of app usage or reviews across countries.

  - Focused on color-coded intensity to reflect engagement volume.

- Applied country codes and integrated geographical data.

✅ Task 3: Bubble Chart (5–7 PM IST)

Objective: Visualize multi-dimensional data involving installs, ratings, and revenue.

- Tools & Techniques Used:

- Created a Plotly bubble chart where:

  - X-axis = Categories

  - Y-axis = Ratings

  - Bubble size = Revenue

  - Bubble color = App type

- Provided insight on which categories dominate across these metrics.

These tasks provided a strong foundation in real-time visualization, multi-variable analysis, and storytelling through data using Python and Plotly.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, Plotly, NumPy)

- Jupyter Notebook

- HTML + CSS (Basic)

- Excel (for initial data prep)

🏁 What's Next?

With the successful completion of this training project, I have also completed my industry-based internship at NullClass, which involved applying these concepts to real-time tasks and analytics problems. This hands-on experience has significantly enhanced my practical skills in data visualization and dashboard building.

It was a great learning experience throughout the internship, and I am now confident and motivated to take on more real-world, hands-on data analytics projects that align with industry expectations.
